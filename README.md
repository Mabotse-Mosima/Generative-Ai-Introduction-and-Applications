# Generative-Ai-Introduction-and-Applications

In this module, I learned the fundamentals of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and how it differs from discriminative AI. I explored the various capabilities of generative AI, including generating text, images, code, speech, video, and even data augmentation.

I also learned about how generative AI is being applied across different sectors and industries such as IT and DevOps, entertainment, education, finance, healthcare, and human resources. I gained insight into how this technology is helping to make our work lives more efficient and productive.

Next, I explored key capabilities and use cases of commonly used tools for generating content across different formatsâ€”text, images, code, audio, video, and virtual worlds. The module included a graded quiz, which helped me reinforce my understanding of the concepts.

There was also a glossary that helped deepen my understanding of generative AI-related terms, and an optional project where I got the chance to practice generating text, images, and code using generative AI tools.

Finally, the module provided guidance on the next steps in my learning journey, helping me understand how to continue building my skills in this exciting field.
